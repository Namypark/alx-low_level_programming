A simple read me file showing what each program as designed to do 

A nested loop is a loop inside another loop. The inner loop executes completely for every iteration of the outer loop. Here's an example of a nested loop in Python:

```
Copy code
for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 4):
        print(i, j)
```
In this example, the outer loop iterates over the values 1, 2, and 3, while the inner loop iterates over the same values 1, 2, and 3 for each value of the outer loop. The output of this code would be
```
1 1
1 2
1 3
2 1
2 2
2 3
3 1
3 2
3 3
```

Note that the inner loop completes its execution for each value of the outer loop before moving on to the next value of the outer loop. Nested loops are commonly used when you need to perform a certain action for every combination of values in two or more sequences or arrays.

0-isupper.c is a function that checks for uppercase character.

1-isdigit.c is a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

2-mul.c is a function that multiplies two integers.

3-print_numbers.c is a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

4-print_most_numbers.c is a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

5-more_numbers.c is a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

6-print_line.c is a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

7-print_diagonal.c is a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

8-print_square.c is a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

9-fizz_buzz.c is a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line, but for multiples of three prints Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five prints Buzz.

10-print_triangle.c is a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.

100-prime_factor.c is a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.

101-print_number.c is a function that prints an integer using only _putchar().

_putchar.c contains the _putchar() function definition.
